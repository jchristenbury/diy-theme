This theme “DIY Theme” is offered “as is”. I’ve done what I can and since it is up on the WordPress repository it passed all the theme tests. Use it how you want. if you have questions or problems I’ll do what I can but; it’s free. 

To Do:
* Typography:
I want to add better typography right out of the box. Right now it’s simple but I want to spice it up a bit. 

Test. 

* Add  Theme Customizer.

* ???

Thanks for downloading.
